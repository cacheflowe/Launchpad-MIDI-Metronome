Launchpad Midi Metronome
===
Provides a visual metronome in the "scene launch" button column on the Launchpad

Getting Started
---
* Open an Ableton project.
* Make sure your Launchpad output "Track" is set to "on" in the "MIDI sync" area of Ableton's preferences.
* Use Ableton's internal file browser to find the .mid file.
* Create a MIDI track, name it Metronome, and drop the MIDI file into your track. 
* You may want to use [cmd/ctrl + e] to disable all of the stop buttons on your MIDI track, since using a "scene launch" button may turn off your metronome.
* Go to the i/o settings panel for your MIDI track, and set the output to the Launchpad.
* Press play, and enjoy the 4-bar metronome pattern.
 
Customizing
---
* You can change the LED colors by changing the velocity of the MIDI notes. 
 * Note that most velocities will leave the buttons blinking, instead of turn them off. 
 * Most velocities that end with the number 7 should respond to the note off signal.
